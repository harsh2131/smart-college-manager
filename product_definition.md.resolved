## 1. The Real Problems Faced by College Students

### 🔴 Attendance Tracking Chaos
| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Students manually track attendance in notebooks or memory | Inaccurate records lead to surprise detention/debarment notices |
| Different faculty have different attendance policies | Confusion about minimum attendance requirements per subject |
| No real-time visibility into current attendance percentage | Students realize they're short only before exams |
| Bunking decisions are made blindly | Over-bunking leads to failing attendance criteria |

### 🔴 Deadline Disaster
| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Assignments announced verbally in class | Students who missed class are unaware |
| Multiple subjects = multiple deadlines scattered across platforms | Missed submissions, grade penalties |
| No centralized reminder system | Students forget until the last moment |
| Internal assessment dates announced weeks prior, then forgotten | Poor preparation, low internal marks |

### 🔴 Resource Fragmentation
| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Notes shared via WhatsApp groups (100+ messages/day) | Important PDFs get buried under memes and chats |
| Google Drive links shared randomly | Broken links, access issues, no organization by subject/topic |
| Previous year question papers scattered | Exam prep becomes a scavenger hunt |
| Different file versions cause confusion | Students study from outdated/incomplete notes |

### 🔴 Internal Marks Blindness
| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Students don't know their internal assessment scores until grades are out | No opportunity to improve |
| Weighted calculations (assignments, quizzes, mids) are complex | Students can't predict final grades |
| No dashboard showing progress | Lack of motivation and direction |
